# image-prompts
These are a list of the images that I have generated using various diffusion models and their associated prompts.

I have not been great at drawing, but I have a pretty good imagination. I like to express myself visually and via whiteboards, but I am artistically challenged. Now with diffusion models, I am able to describe what I want to draw and have the model render the image. This will help me as an educator to explain what's on my mind better and hopefully connect better with my audience. 

All the work that I create this way will be published in the public domain, for anyone to see, use, and improve upon.

Let's Go!!!
