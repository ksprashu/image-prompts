**Base Prompt:**
_An image of a programmer doing some coding in front of a computer. I am seeing the back of the programmer as they are typing away on the keyboard. They are having 5 monitors in front of them - 3 in one row in line with the head and 2 more above the line of 3 monitors, centered. The monitors are displaying programs related to coding, like a browser with api documentation on one, an IDE where the developers is coding on the middle one, a terminal screen on another, and so on. The programmer is typing away so fast that their hands are blur and it looks like the programmer has 3 pairs of hands. Make this in the style of a black and white line drawing with a retro theme. The image has grayscale shading done to make the image pop out._

**Model Used:**
ChatGPT 4 with DALL-E

**Notes:**
1. Had to do some additional tweaks to try and get more hands in a motion blur, but it didn't work out. Finally decided to go with just the default human hands.
2. The model doesn't know how to count and renders 6 monitors as opposed to 5.
