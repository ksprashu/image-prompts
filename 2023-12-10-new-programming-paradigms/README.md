**Base Prompt:**
_I am writing a blog on new ways to solve problems. or new paradigms. Not just by coding, but with coding assistants, maybe even asking bard to generate code, and finally just asking bard to give an answer. 

I want an image where the programmer is waving a magic wand at the PC monitor. There is some indication that there is a problem that needs solving, on the screen. Viewed from the rear 2/3rd of the programmer._

**Notes:**
1. This time I tried to experiment with giving some context to the mode on what I was going to be talking about.
2. I forgot to mention a style this time.
3. The first image generated with a wand each in both the hands, I had to tell it to render only one.
